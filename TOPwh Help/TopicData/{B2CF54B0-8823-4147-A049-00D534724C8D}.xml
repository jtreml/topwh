    <s k="BodyText"><![CDATA[<P>This has been the main goal of this program. This task doesn't look easy on a first glance but isn't this complicated either, as it can be split up in two smaller tasks:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Connecting the outer polygon with the polygon inside representing the hole and thus creating a new polygon consisting of both of them.</LI>
<LI>Triangulating the new, combined polygon.</LI></OL>
<P>If the outer polygon contains more the one hole, just connect it with one of the holes and then connect the resulting, combined&nbsp;polygon with the next hole and so on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This way the task has been split up in <A href="Connecting nested polygons.html">connecting nested polygons</A> and the <A href="Triangulation of polygons.html">triangulation of one single polygon</A>. See the linked topics on how to achieve each of the tasks.</P>]]></s>
